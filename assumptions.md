# Assumptions

This file outlines the assumptions made during the development of this technical challenge.

---

- [ ] I assumed Next.js 15.5.0 was acceptable, as it is the current stable version at the time of development.

- [ ] I assumed the App Router (app/) was acceptable instead of the legacy Pages Router.

- [ ] I assumed it was acceptable to expose the API URL via the NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL environment variable.

- [ ] I assumed the evaluation team will access the deployed app via the Vercel domain (https://technical-challenge-joaquin.vercel.app/) or run a local dev instance:

```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
```
